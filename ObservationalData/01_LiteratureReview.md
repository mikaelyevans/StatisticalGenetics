<h3>Ancestry</h3>
<p>
    Genes give insights into both visible and invisible qualities about humans, making them very useful for anticipating disease inheritance, physical qualities, and ancestry. In fact, there are many consumer genetics companies including ancestry.com and 23andMe that give individuals insights into their health and ancestry by assessing their genomes and comparing with other genomes that they have in their database. People have a desire to know more about their ancestry, but how is ancestry truly defined?
</p>
<p>
Ancestry is a term that most of us have defined in our own heads through knowledge we have accumulated over our lifetimes, usually having to do with origins of a person’s family. The journal article <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008624">What is Ancestry? (PLOS Genetics)</a> examines this topic in a more scientific context. The authors define genetic ancestors as the “individuals from whom you are biologically descended” and ancestry as “information about [ancestors] and their genetic relationship to you”. We have tended to simplify ancestry by categorizing it into certain groups like race, ethnicity, region, and country, but the truth is that ancestry and inheritance do not fit into these perfect categories. By dividing people into these different ancestry categories, we introduce the possibility of discrimination, misrepresentation, and division across categories.

<h3>Race and Ethnicity</h3>
<p>
Race is an example of a human-made classification system that has had divisive effects on people for centuries. There is nothing in our genes that “codes” for what race we identify as. Self-identification of race and ethnicity in surveys, job applications, and more has become integrated into our society and peoples’ sense of self. The journal article <a href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(14)00476-5?theme=Untitled%2Cmontraykreyol.org%2Farticle%2F%7B-%7D%3Ftheme%2Cmontraykreyol.org%2C0.016772065"> The Genetic Ancestry of African Americans, Latinos, and European Americans Across the United States (American Journal of Human Genetics)</a> discusses the difference between Americans’ <strong>genetic</strong> and <strong>self-reported</strong> ancestries, races, and ethnicities. This paper uses a <strong>Genome Wide Association Study</strong> (GWAS), an analysis of individuals’ entire genome, to group people by geographic origin and compare with their self-reported identities to examine the type of variation we see across the genomes.
</p>
<p>
The authors ask several main questions: Is it possible to see distinct ancestral groups, or is there a continuous spectrum of ancestral variation in individuals? If there are distinct ancestral clusters, do they accurately represent an individual’s geographic origin? The study shows that it is possible for genes to accurately predict an individual’s geographic origin, and that ancestry is more complex than individuals usually perceive. 
</p>
<p>
A way to combat this categorization is to instead look at ancestry geographically. The scientific journal article <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07331"> Genes Mirror Geography Within Europe (Nature)</a> performed a study that shows this occurrence of genes mirroring geography and suggests that ancestral geography be used as a grouping factor instead of classifications like race and ethnicity. This article argues for the use of geographical descriptors instead of race and ethnicity and generally calls for an open discussion on how categorizers are selected in scientific research.

<h3>Population Structure</h3>
<p>
	Observational data introduces confounding variables, or variables that influence both the dependent variable and predictor of interest. Confounding variables can introduce Type 1 Error, false positive results, and make scientific study statistics inaccurate. Some of these examples include population structure, familial relationships, and more. In this content summary, we will focus on how population structure as a confounding variable can be accounted for in genome wide analysis studies. 
</p>
<p>
	In the following Qmd, we will go through an example of using <strong>Principal Component Analysis</strong> in a GWAS to adjust for population structure. There will be examples of visualizations that are commonly used in this field including QQ plots and PCA Loadings and Scree plots. Enjoy!
