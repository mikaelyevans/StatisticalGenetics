<h1>Observational Data in Statistical Genetics</h1>
<h3><strong>Created by Mikaely Evans</strong></h3>

<p><strong>This GitHub repository contains a content summary of the Observational Data unit in Statistical Genetics with Professor Kelsey Grinde at Macalester College.</strong></p>

<h3>Observational Data</h3>
<p>
    Data comes in many different forms. In science, there are two main types of data: observational and experimental. Observational data is taken from real-world observations that have not been altered by a scientific experiment. On the contrary, experimental data comes from scientific experiments that have independent variables that the scientist has control to change. In genetics, observational data is the most common data format because there is no ethical way to change a human’s DNA for the purpose of scientific study, since this would involve introducing mutations that could alter a person’s disease inheritance, physical qualities, and genetic ancestry.

    While it is amazing that scientists can use observational data to study genetics, observational data comes with its own unique set of challenges. This content summary explains the approaches that scientists use to analyze observational genetic data and why they are effective.
    There is also a step by step example that demonstrates the processes of working with observational data including PCA and GWAS.
